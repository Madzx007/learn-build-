The hosting model for the computing resources that power apps is referred to as a compute service4. "Compute" refers to ideas and items associated with software computation in cloud computing. Processing power, memory, networking, storage, and other resources necessary for each program's computational success are collectively referred to by this general term2.

Cloud providers such as Azure¹⁴ and Amazon Web capabilities (AWS) provide a variety of computational capabilities. Here are a few instances from AWS:

- Instances (virtual machines): Amazon Elastic computation Cloud (Amazon EC2) offers scalable and secure computation resources (virtual servers) in the cloud1.
*Containers*: To run containers, use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), which provides a very dependable, scalable, and safe solution1. 
*Serverless*: You can run code without a server using AWS Lambda.

# networking serivce 
Applications that function at the network application layer are known as network services. They provide users with access to data and applications across a network2. Usually, servers6 are used to run these services. Examples of network services include the following:

*Online gaming* - *Printing* - *File server* - *Directory services* - *Email* - *File sharing* - *Instant messaging* - *Video on demand* - *Video telephony*¹

Some categories of network services consist of:

- *Branch office and campus connectivity* - *Internet and cloud connectivity* - *Secure cloud-connectivity services* - *Virtual network services* 

Additionally, certain network designs and services exist, like:

SASE (Secure Access Service Edge): This network design blends cloud-native security features with software-defined wide-area network (SD-WAN) capabilities. Users can access protected applications from any location with its help.
