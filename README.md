# coumpute serivce
The hosting model for the computing resources that power apps is referred to as a compute service4. "Compute" refers to ideas and items associated with software computation in cloud computing. Processing power, memory, networking, storage, and other resources necessary for each program's computational success are collectively referred to by this general term2.

Cloud providers such as Azure¹⁴ and Amazon Web capabilities (AWS) provide a variety of computational capabilities. Here are a few instances from AWS:

- Instances (virtual machines): Amazon Elastic computation Cloud (Amazon EC2) offers scalable and secure computation resources (virtual servers) in the cloud1.
*Containers*: To run containers, use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), which provides a very dependable, scalable, and safe solution1. 
*Serverless*: You can run code without a server using AWS Lambda.

# networking serivce 
Applications that function at the network application layer are known as network services. They provide users with access to data and applications across a network2. Usually, servers6 are used to run these services. Examples of network services include the following:

*Online gaming* - *Printing* - *File server* - *Directory services* - *Email* - *File sharing* - *Instant messaging* - *Video on demand* - *Video telephony*¹

Some categories of network services consist of:

- *Branch office and campus connectivity* - *Internet and cloud connectivity* - *Secure cloud-connectivity services* - *Virtual network services* 

Additionally, certain network designs and services exist, like:

SASE (Secure Access Service Edge): This network design blends cloud-native security features with software-defined wide-area network (SD-WAN) capabilities. Users can access protected applications from any location with its help.

# Inbounded and outbounded rule creations
Rules are designed to regulate traffic to and from your computer, both inbound and outgoing. 

If you are hosting a web server on your computer, for instance, you can use *inbound rules* to enable external connections to your system1. 

Certain programs are allowed to access the internet while others are blocked by *outbound rules*. Outbound policies by default permit all traffic on all protocols2.

By selecting the New rule option from the pick list under Inbound Rules or Outbound Rules, respectively, you can create new inbound and outbound rules. Either a bespoke rule or a pre-established protocol can be used. 

You can use the following steps, for example, to establish an inbound rule in Windows Defender:1. Open the Group Policy Management Console to Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security.

# IAM and security monitering
The protection of an organization's data and resources is facilitated by Identity and Access Management (IAM), a critical component of contemporary IT1. It controls access to ensure that the proper persons, such as hackers, are prevented from entering and that the correct people can carry out their duties1. Verified entities have secure access to company resources, including databases, emails, data, and applications, thanks to IAM1.

IAM consists of two components: access management and identity management.A login attempt is verified by identity management using an identity management database, which is a running list of all authorized users1. As individuals join or leave the company, their responsibilities and projects change, and the organization's scope changes, this data has to be updated on a regular basis1.

Monitoring security is crucial to preserving the dependability, accessibility, and efficiency of IAM.

# Role base access management
Role-based access control (RBAC)* is a security feature that limits authorized users' access to a system according to their position within an organization. It is a method for putting in place either discretionary access control (DAC) or mandatory access control (MAC). ². RBAC allows access based on a user's requirements specific to their role. *. 

Built on top of Azure Resource Manager, *Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)* in Azure offers fine-grained access management to Azure resources. ³. You can control who can access Azure resources, what they can do with them, and which locations they can reach with its assistance ¹. Any user, group, service principal, or managed identity wanting access to Azure resources can have a role assigned to them.
